 I am a third year Gradute Student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh working under the supervision of *[Dr. Rachel Bezanson](https://rachelbezanson.github.io/). My research focuses on understanding the dynamics and evolution of high-redshift galaxies statistically through cosmic time using high resolution spectroscopy and multi-band photometry. I am interested in studying the recovery of star-formation histories and the interplay of stellar population parameters like stellar metallicity, light-weighted ages and dust attenuation with morphology, feedback processes and environment. Most of my analysis so far involve working with *[LEGA-C Spectroscopic Survey](https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/home/legac/) data products and Bayesian SED Modeling package *[BAGPIPES](https://github.com/ACCarnall/bagpipes/blob/master/docs/index.rst). I am an engineer-turned-astronophysicist, love talking about science and currently serving as an Outreach Coordinator for *[Women and Minorities in Physics (WMP)](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/women-and-minorities-physics-pitt) Group at Pitt. When not doing research, I could be found doing *[Zoomba](https://twitter.com/KaushalYasha/status/1379159957518610441), *[Orange Theory Fitness](https://www.orangetheory.com/en-us/?utm_source=us&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=Orangetheory-PPC-Brand-General&utm_term=tombras&utm_content=2_free&gclid=Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIajVa7XVxQG45bbt9Uf8s0gXjW_YKXs2ZLxLkqdxVEVPPfzVg460EkaArQKEALw_wcB), *[Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_vUyVNzOU) or Gardening.
