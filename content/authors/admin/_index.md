 I am a final year Physics PhD student who is passionate about data-driven research and applying advanced statistical tools to gain insights from big data. I am committed to continuous learning and keeping up with emerging technologies. I come from a diverse background with over 8 years of dedicated research experience and involved in some great diversity initiatives - currently serving as the President of [Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering](https://sites.google.com/view/adsepitt/home)(ADSE@Pitt) and Outreach Coordinator for [Women and Minorities in Physics (WMP)](https://sites.google.com/view/wmp-physics-pitt/home) Group at the University of Pittsburgh. When not doing research, I could be found listening to [Super Data Science Podcast](https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast) (highly recommended!), doing [Zoomba](https://twitter.com/KaushalYasha/status/1379159957518610441), [Orange Theory Fitness](https://www.orangetheory.com/en-us/?utm_source=us&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=Orangetheory-PPC-Brand-General&utm_term=tombras&utm_content=2_free&gclid=Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIajVa7XVxQG45bbt9Uf8s0gXjW_YKXs2ZLxLkqdxVEVPPfzVg460EkaArQKEALw_wcB) or [Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_vUyVNzOU).
